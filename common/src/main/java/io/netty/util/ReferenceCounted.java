 * <p>

 * {@link #retain()} increases the reference count, and {@link #release()} decreases the reference count.
 * If the reference count is decreased to {@code 0}, the object will be deallocated explicitly, and accessing
 * the deallocated object will usually result in an access violation.

 * If an object that implements {@link ReferenceCounted} is a container of other objects that implement
 * {@link ReferenceCounted}, the contained objects will also be released via {@link #release()} when the container's
 * reference count becomes 0.
